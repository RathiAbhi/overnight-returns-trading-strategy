# overnight-returns-trading-strategy
This repository contains a notebook explaining how overnight returns can be captured using a couple of trading strategies.

Note: This work was done as an assignment for Quant Analyst role at QuantInsti.

First of all, the strategy is inspired from this paper: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1004081
The above paper carries out a study that shows its analysis over US stocks on a data of around 10-15 years that overnight returns are more signinficant as compared to day returns. 

I coded a strategy to capture the overnight returns for the Amazon and Apple stock, where I allocated an equal amount of capital to both of these stocks. I presenred the performance of the trading strategy with a pnl curve, sharpe ratio and max drawdown plot. I also added trade level analytics such as winners, losers and profit factor etc. I have tried to highlight the improvements as well which can be done, and performed the trading with three strategies.
